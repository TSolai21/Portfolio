              I'm Solaikumar, a Front-End Developer who loves making websites
              that people enjoy using. With 2 years of experience, I'm really
              good with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€“ the building blocks of the
              web. I also know my way around React, Angular, and Next.js, which
              are like special tools for making websites even cooler. My goal is
              to create websites that are easy to use and look great, so
              everyone has a great time surfing the web.
